# Commuting to Paris

This repo is an example on how to make a network visualisation with [pyvis](https://pyvis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html) python package.

The data comes from the French Census made in 2020 by INSEE and has been retrieved with [pynsee](https://pynsee.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) python package.

See the notebook in this repo to reproduce the outcome and have a look at the webpage here, 1-2 minutes are necessary to visualize the plot: https://hadrilec.github.io/commuting_paris/
